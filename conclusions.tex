\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{Conclusions}

This paper revisits the trip itinerary planning problem and proposes a novel solution framework called \trip that returns an \emph{optimal itinerary} as a solution for practical scenarios. This solution allows multi-day itinerary planning that not only considers the tourist's starting and ending locations and timings, but also adheres to the operational timings of each POI. The proposed solution is unique and powerful due to its ability to accommodate multiple transportation modes, factoring of user-specified personalized constraints such as must-see constraints, must-avoid constraints, ordering constraints and category constraints, consideration of multiple utility variants, and the capability of dynamic re-planning of the itinerary to account for unplanned delays or early exits experienced during the previously visited POIs. Empirical evaluation on several popular destinations show the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed solution.

In future, other transportation modes such as cycle, public bus and metro can be considered. Further, real-time crowd and resulting waiting times at each POI can be factored to generate more useful itineraries.
