\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Dataset Description}
In order to test our itinerary planning system, we used curated datasets of Points of Interest (POIs) for seven large cities: Delhi, Budapest, Vienna, Osaka, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Perth. \ari{Americans will be very unhappy.} The initial dataset utilized is derived from the \textbf{Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons 100 Million Dataset (YFCC100M)} \cite{}, \ari{Missing citation.} containing over 100 million images, of which 69 million are annotated and 48 million are geotagged. \ab{69+48>100.} \ari{Some of the images are common, i.e., both annotated and geotagged.}

We used the Flickr User-POI Visits dataset available at ~\cite{limkwanhuiDataCode}, \ab{are we using 2 separate datasets?} which was generated in the following manner. In order to generate this dataset, the authors of the paper ~\cite{taylor2018tour} took a set of popular POIs for every city mentioned earlier using resources such as \textit{Wikipedia}. Then, geotagged photos in \textit{Flickr} were matched with these POIs using spatial proximity. By estimating relative \textbf{popularity} of a POI through the counts of photos for every POI, the relative popularity which is referred to as utility was estimated.

This approach generates an empirical proxy for real tourist behavior, measuring interest in a specific attraction as measured by publicly accessible, crowd-sourced images.

The existing dataset contained the following key fields for each POI:

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabularx}{0.5\textwidth}{p{3cm} X}
\hline
\textbf{Field Name} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
\texttt{poiID} & A unique identifier assigned to each POI. \\
\hline
\texttt{poiName} & The name of the POI, e.g., ``Red Fort'', ``Osaka Castle''. \\
\hline
\texttt{lat} & Latitude coordinate of the POI. \\
\hline
\texttt{long} & Longitude coordinate of the POI. \\
\hline
\texttt{theme or category} & Thematic classification of the POI, such as \textit{amusement}, \textit{historical}, \textit{museum}, \textit{shopping}, \textit{park}, etc. \\
\hline
\texttt{Utility Score or Profit} & A numerical value representing the estimated utility or attractiveness of the POI, derived based on its popularity (photo frequency). \\
\hline
\texttt{Cost} & Geospatial travel distance (in meters) between pairs of POIs. This is used in the travel time estimation between locations, with the walking speed $v_w$ and taxi speed $v_t$. \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Original dataset fields}
\end{table}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

With an aim to make our system more realistic and practical to use, we supplemented the dataset manually with real-life operating limitations and data that we gathered from \textbf{official tourist websites} and verified online portals. The added fields are:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabularx}{0.5\textwidth}{p{3cm} X}
\toprule
\textbf{Field Name} & \textbf{Description} \\
\midrule
\texttt{fees} & Entrance fee or ticket price associated with the POI, in INR. \\
\midrule
\texttt{opening time} & The time at which the POI opens for visitors, stored in \texttt{HH:MM:SS} format. \\
\midrule
\texttt{closing time} & The time at which the POI closes for visitors, stored similarly. \\
\midrule
\texttt{Days of Week} & Seven binary columns (\texttt{Monday}, \texttt{Tuesday}, ..., \texttt{Sunday}). A value of 1 indicates the POI is open on that day; 0 indicates it is closed. \\
\midrule
\texttt{Avg Visiting Time} & The average duration (in minutes) tourists typically spend at the POI. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Additional features added to the dataset}
\end{table}

These manually extracted features add a \textbf{temporal and availability aspect} to the optimisation problem, allowing more realistic and accurate itinerary generation. For example, POIs closed on the chosen day are excluded from the planning automatically.

All the other information was collected by scraping or quoting \textbf{official tourist boards}, \textbf{city tourism websites}, and trustworthy travel websites.

\subsection{Configuration}

The experiments were conducted on a MacBook Air equipped with an Apple M1 processor and 8GB of RAM, providing a lightweight yet efficient environment for developing and testing the itinerary planning system. The implementation was carried out in Python, leveraging its rich ecosystem for data handling, user interaction, and visualization. The core optimization process was performed using the Gurobi Optimizer, a state-of-the-art solver for mathematical programming. Gurobi was employed to solve the underlying Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations that generate optimized multi-day travel itineraries under various user-defined constraints and real-world conditions.

\subsection{Baseline Itinerary Planner}

To establish a baseline for evaluation, we implemented the itinerary planning model described in Taylor and Lim \cite{taylor2018tour}, which we refer to as the \textbf{baseline model}. This model adopts a binary decision framework, where each Point of Interest (POI) is either fully included in the itinerary or completely excluded. The utility function in this setting is defined as:

\[
\max \left\{ \sum_{i=2}^{N} \sum_{j=2}^{N} S_i \cdot x_{i,j} \right\},
\]

where \( x_{i,j} = 1 \) if POI \( i \) is visited immediately before POI \( j \), and 0 otherwise. \ab{what is $s_i$?} This is equivalent to the binary utility formulation:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{N} U(v_i) \cdot y_i
\]

where \( U(v_i) \) denotes the utility of POI \( v_i \), and \( y_i \in \{0,1\} \) is a binary variable indicating whether \( v_i \) is selected in the itinerary.

The baseline model incorporates only fundamental constraints, including the time budget constraint, connectivity requirements, a restriction preventing a direct path between the start and the end POIs, and  sub-tour elimination constraints. In our implementation, the sub-tour elimination is effectively enforced using arrival-time-based constraints. We were able to seamlessly adapt our ILP-based framework to replicate this baseline behavior, effectively converting our advanced planner into a simplified version matching the baseline model's structure.

However, direct performance comparison between our model and the baseline was not feasible due to a key limitation in the common dataset used by both our system and Taylor and Lim \cite{taylor2018tour} --namely, the absence of standardized POI visiting durations. Second, the baseline paper distributed POI visit durations by an unspecified method, making it impossible to reproduce exactly the same execution cases. Despite this, we were able to re-implement the baseline model in its entirety in terms of constraints as well as utility structure, which provided a good basis for qualitative analysis. \ab{No mention of absence of cost budget}

\subsection{9 Variants of the \trip}

We evaluate the performance of the \trip solution by considering its variants as listed in Table~\ref{tab:trip_variants}, that are based on the transportation mode and the chosen utility variant. 
\begin{table}[H]

    \item \textbf{Running Time:} The time (in seconds) required by the system to compute the itinerary. It is an indicator of the system's computational efficiency.
    
    \item \textbf{Time Utilisation:} The percentage of the user-provided time budget that is actually used in the itinerary:

        \item \textbf{Travel Time Fraction:} Ratio of time spent traveling between POIs to the total available time.
        \item \textbf{Visit Time Fraction:} Ratio of time spent visiting POIs to the total available time.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\ab{Add Cost Utilization}

These metrics serve as the basis for the comparative analysis and graphical illustrations presented in the subsequent section.

\subsection{Demonstrations}

To demonstrate the performance and insights of our itinerary planning system, we begin with a comprehensive visualization in Figure~\ref{fig:cities}, which presents the variation of utility across different time and cost budgets for all seven cities in our dataset. This offers a broad perspective on how the system adapts to varying resource constraints in diverse urban environments. For the remainder of the analysis, we focus on the city of Osaka as a representative case. Unless stated otherwise, the default time budget is varied within a practical range of 480 to 600 minutes, and the cost budget is chosen to be appropriately aligned with the economic characteristics of the city. This approach allows us to maintain clarity while drawing generalizable conclusions from representative trends observed in one city.

\newpage
\noindent \textbf{Comparison 9 variants with the Baseline Model}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{plots/singledaycomparison.png}
\caption{Comparison of Single-day trips with Baseline Model}
\label{fig:comparisonWithBaselinePlot_singleday}
\end{figure}
\noindent
\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:comparisonWithBaselinePlot_singleday}} illustrates the comparison of utility scores across different trip durations for various models under a high cost budget scenario (1,00,000 units). A clear upward trend is observed across all models, indicating that utility increases with longer trip durations—consistent with the intuitive understanding that more time allows for visiting more POIs.

Notably, the \textit{Binary-Walking} variant of our model closely replicates the behavior of the \textit{Baseline model}, validating its correctness and fairness for comparative purposes. However, our advanced models—especially those incorporating partial POI visits and additional travel modes such as \textit{Taxi} and \textit{Hybrid}—consistently outperform the baseline in terms of utility. Among these, the \textit{CLF (Continuous Linear Function)} utility model with \textit{Hybrid mode} demonstrates the highest utility scores, indicating the effectiveness of both the advanced utility formulation and flexible transport options in enhancing itinerary quality.

Interestingly, at the cost cap of 1,00,000 units, the utility scores of \textit{Taxi} and \textit{Hybrid} modes overlap, suggesting that under a relaxed cost constraint, both modes are able to achieve similar performance. This cost ceiling is deliberately set to eliminate cost-related influences, ensuring a fair comparison focused on time and utility behavior because the baseline model is not capable of handling cost related factors.

Overall, the plot effectively highlights how our approach—especially the allowance for partial POI visits and the use of flexible transport—leads to significantly improved itinerary recommendations, both in terms of utility and adaptability to real-world constraints.



\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{plots/baselineComparison_pkj.png}
\caption{Comparison of Multi-day trips with Baseline Model}
\label{fig:comparisonWithBaselinePlot}
\end{figure}

The plot~\ref{fig:comparisonWithBaselinePlot} compares the performance of our proposed trip planning variants against a baseline model for trips ranging from one to four days. For a fair comparison, the time budget was fixed at 8 hours per day, and the cost budget was set high at 1,00,000 units - ensuring that cost wouldn’t be a limiting factor, especially for the baseline. The baseline utilities were calculated by creating daily itineraries one after another, making sure not to repeat any POIs from previous days, and summing up the utilities. On the other hand, the nine other variants represent results from our optimized multi-day planning models, which take a more holistic approach. As seen in the graph, all of our variants consistently outperform the baseline across all durations. Given this clear advantage, we have chosen to leave the baseline out of future comparisons to keep things focused. Moreover, this setup results in identical utility values for taxi and hybrid modes, as taxi usage becomes universally optimal due to its time-saving advantage when cost is not an issue. \\

\noindent\textbf{Effect of Multi-modality}

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{plots/multimodality1.png}
\label{fig:mm1}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{plots/multimodality2.png}
\caption{Variation of Utility in single-day trips in 9 variants}
\label{fig:mm2}
\end{figure}

\noindent\textbf{Legend Description}\\
Figure ~\ref{fig:mm2}  distinguishes utility computation variants (B, C, S) using different line colors. The travel modes are represented by markers: circle for Walking, star for Taxi, and triangle for Hybrid mode. For instance, a blue star denotes $TRIP\_T\_B$ mode, orange triangle denotes $TRIP\_H\_S$ mode and so on.

This experiment was done to illustrate the impact of varying time and cost budgets on the utility achieved by different transportation modes in our itinerary planning framework. The top graph explores how increasing the time budget (with a fixed cost budget of 6000 units) affects utility. Here, we observe that the utility continues to increase for walking and hybrid modes, while it saturates for the taxi-only variant. This is because the taxi mode relies heavily on cost availability—once the fixed cost budget is consumed, additional time offers very little, to no further improvement. In contrast, the hybrid mode, which leverages both walking and taxi flexibly, consistently outperforms the single-mode options across all three TRIP variants, highlighting the effectiveness of our multi-modality feature.

The lower graph, which holds the time budget constant at 480 minutes while increasing the cost budget, further supports this observation: hybrid models adapt more efficiently to increased resource availability, maximizing utility better than single-mode approaches. In this case, the utility for walking-only variants remains saturated across all TRIP variants, as the potential gains from walking are constrained by the fixed time rather than by cost. Furthermore, a consistent trend is observed wherein the CLF (Continuous Linear Function) scoring model outperforms the slab-based model. This is because CLF assigns utility proportionally to the time spent at a POI—for example, visiting a POI for 63\% of its average duration yields 63\% utility—while the slab model would round this down to 60\% based on predefined thresholds, resulting in a measurable loss. Together, both graphs validate our design choices, demonstrating the combined advantages of multi-modal transportation and continuous utility modeling in enhancing itinerary quality.\\

\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{fig:TimeUtilization} and ~\ref{fig:TimeUtilization1} present a comparison of travel time versus visit time across the three TRIP variants---walking-only (TRIP\_W), taxi-only (TRIP\_T), and hybrid (TRIP\_H)---at a fixed time budget of 480 minutes and varying cost budgets (5000, 6000, 7000, and 8000 units) and at a fixed cost budget of 6000 units and varying time budgets (480, 540, 600 and 660 minutes) respectively. Across all three utility scoring versions (B, C, and S), a clear trend emerges: TRIP\_W exhibits a high travel-to-visit time ratio, reflecting the slower nature of walking as a mode of transport. In contrast, TRIP\_T minimizes travel time due to exclusive reliance on taxis, thereby maximizing time spent at points of interest (POIs). The hybrid model, TRIP\_H, maintains a balanced ratio between travel and visit time, offering a compromise between the two extremes. While the taxi-only model may seem efficient in terms of maximizing visit time, earlier experiments have demonstrated that it is the hybrid TRIP\_H that achieves the highest overall utility. Across all variants, increasing time budget allowed better utilization of available time, with Hybrid mode consistently providing the most balanced performance across travel and visit times. This highlights that optimizing for utility involves not just maximizing visit duration but also strategically balancing travel efficiency with multi-modal flexibility.\\

\noindent \textbf{How to Read the Graphs}

\noindent The graph uses \textbf{colored lines} to represent different \textbf{cost budgets}—for example in Osaka we use blue for 5000 units, green for 10000 units, and red for 15000 units—while \textbf{symbols on the lines} denote different versions of the itinerary planner: squares for \textit{Binary}, triangles for \textit{Slab}, and plus signs for \textit{Continuous Function (CF)}. Each line formed by a specific combination of color and symbol indicates the \textbf{utility trend} for a particular planner variant at a given cost budget. For instance, in Osaka the \textbf{blue line with square markers} represents the performance of the \textit{Binary version} at a \textbf{cost budget of 5000 units}. This combination-based encoding enables a comparative analysis of planner performance across various time and cost constraints.

\noindent\textbf{Insights}

\noindent Figure~\ref{fig:cities} illustrates how the achieved utility varies across different combinations of time and cost budgets for the seven cities in our dataset. A few consistent trends emerge across all cities. First, for a fixed cost budget, increasing the available time consistently leads to higher utility, highlighting the value of longer exploration durations. Second, for a given time budget, allocating a higher cost budget also results in improved utility, indicating the benefit of greater financial flexibility. Most notably, the C variant consistently outperforms both the S and B versions in terms of utility achieved, suggesting its superior effectiveness in balancing constraints across diverse urban scenarios.\\

\caption{Trends in Multi-day itineraries (3-day Trip)}
\label{fig:util_md}
\end{figure}

Figure ~\ref{fig:util_md} presents the utility trends for the multi-day variant of our itinerary planner for a 3 day trip. Similar to the single-day analysis, a consistent increasing trend in utility results is observed with fixed cost budget and increasing time budget and vice-versa, across the various formulations. Specifically, the utility achieved using the fractional variant is consistently higher than that of the binary variant, reaffirming the advantages of allowing partial visitations in enhancing overall experience. Furthermore, within the fractional formulations, the CLF (Continuous Linear Fractional) approach typically yields higher utility than the slab-based version, demonstrating its stronger capability to balance constraints and exploit budget flexibility effectively across multiple days of planning. However slabbed version works better than the binary version and thus it can be used to mathematically model the non linear utility functions in our problem which otherwise cannot be handled directly by ILP solvers and thus resulting in a better performance than the binary version.\\

\noindent\textbf{Multi-day Trips vs 3 single day trips}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{plots/multivssingle.png}
\caption{Comparison of aggregated Single day trips with 2 day and 3 day multi-day trips}
\label{fig:singlevsmultiday}
\end{figure}
Figure ~\ref{fig:singlevsmultiday}  illustrates a comparison of total utility achieved with different trip planning configurations: aggregated 3 single-day trips versus actual 2-day and 3-day multi-day itineraries, optimized for both Binary and CLF versions. In this experiment, each day was assigned an equal time budget of 480 minutes. For single-day trips, the cost budget was uniformly set at 2000 units per day, and for the multi-day cases, the aggregate cost budgets were similarly scaled: 4000 units for 2-day and 6000 units for 3-day trips. As a basis of comparison, the 3 single day trips were: source-to-hotel travel (bottom segment), hotel-to-destination travel (middle segment), and hotel-to-hotel travel (top segment). The last two segments are swapped for a fair comparison with 2-Day multiday trip version.\\

The results clearly demonstrate that multi-day planning consistently outperforms naive aggregation over single days. In the Binary variant, the 2-day multi-day plan has a score of 4084, whereas two single-day plans aggregated give lower cumulative utility. Similarly, in the 3-day variant, the multi-day plan has a score of 5349, much higher than the three single-day utilities summed up. The same is the case with the CLF variant, where the multi-day plans (4218 for 2-day, 5382 for 3-day) consistently beat the aggregated single-day tallies. This improved performance is due to the flexibility and optimization advantages of multi-day planning, where activities and itineraries can be optimized globally over multiple days as opposed to being restricted within independent daily plans. Thus, multi-day trip planning is not a single-day plan aggregation but a richer solution space that optimally exploits inter-day complementarities.
\noindent\textbf{Effect of personalized constraints on Utility}
\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Effect of Must-see, ordering and category constraints}
\label{fig:personalizedconstraints}
\end{figure}

The impact of incorporating personalized constraints, that is, must-see, ordering, and category constraints, on overall utility is illustrated in the three graphs in figure ~\ref{fig:personalizedconstraints}. In this study a cost budget of 6000 units and a time budget of 480 minutes is utilized and across all cases, it is evident that increasing the number of constraints leads to a decline in the achievable utility, as the solution space becomes more restricted. However, the extent of this reduction varies across the different formulations. Specifically, the CLF and slab variants show a relatively gradual decline in utility compared to the binary variant. This is primarily because the binary model lacks the flexibility to accommodate partial visits to points of interest (POIs), thereby limiting its ability to adapt to tighter constraints. In contrast, the CLF and slab variants can better navigate these constraints by leveraging their ability to assign fractional visits, thus preserving higher utility under increasingly personalized user preferences.\\

\end{figure*}

\noindent\textbf{1. How to Read ~\ref{fig:dynamic}}

This grouped bar chart in Figure ~\ref{fig:dynamic} compares utility values (Y-axis) for three Points of Interest (POIs) under five different time-spent variations. The five scenarios include: (1) \textit{90\% Less Visiting Time}, where the user spends 90\% lesser time at a POI; (2) \textit{50\% Less Visiting Time}, where the user spends 50\% lesser time at a POI; and (3) \textit{Ontime}, where the user spends the suggested time at all POIs; (4) \textit{150\% More Visiting Time}, where the user spends 150\% more time at a POI; (5) \textit{200\% More Visiting Time}, where the user spends 200\% more time at a POI. 
In all cases, travel times between any pair of POIs remain unaffected by user behaviour, and it takes the same time to travel by the user as suggested. Each POI has five bars, each representing a scenario from spending 90\% less time to 200\% more time than suggested at that POI. Bar heights indicate utility levels, with values labeled on top. Distinct patterns and colors differentiate time-spent categories, as indicated in the legend.\\

\noindent\textbf{2. Insights}

Our planner dynamically recalculates the itinerary by considering the actual time a user spends at each Point of Interest (POI) and the time taken to travel between them, in contrast to the initially suggested schedule.  As shown in figure, at a time budget of 480 minutes and cost budget of 6000 units in TRIP\_H\_B variant, the \textbf{utility consistently decreases} as the time spent at a POI increases.

This trend can be explained as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Spending \textbf{less time} at a POI allows the user to \textbf{save time}, which can be used to visit \textbf{additional POIs}, thereby increasing the overall utility.
    \item Conversely, as more time is spent at a single POI, the user has \textbf{less time available} to explore other POIs, resulting in a \textbf{decrease in total utility}.
\end{itemize}

\noindent This variation in utility values underscores the importance of adapting the itinerary based on real-time user behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dynamically responsive planning approach.\\
 
\noindent\textbf{Scalability}\\
To evaluate the scalability of our itinerary planning system, we examine how the computation time required to generate a complete itinerary varies with the number of Points of Interest (POIs) in a city, while keeping the time and cost budgets fixed at sufficiently accommodating values of 480 minutes and 6000 units respectively. As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:scalability1}, the observed increase in computation time with the number of POIs is expected, given that our approach is formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). This growth aligns with the theoretical complexity of the underlying problem — a variant of the Team Orienteering Problem — which is known to be NP-Hard. Despite this, our formulation remains tractable for problem sizes typical of real-world tourist cities. Despite this theoretical complexity, our system demonstrates strong practical performance. For instance, with approximately 180 POIs, the itinerary is generated in under 1 minute. Even with nearly 260 POIs, the computation time remains approximately 5 minutes. These results highlight that, for realistically sized cities, our system maintains high computational efficiency, making it a viable and scalable solution for real-world deployment.

In order to further check the scalability of the suggested itinerary planning system, we designed an experiment by increasing the number of days in the trip and keeping the budget for resources constant. The time budget was chosen as 480 minutes per day and the cost budget as 6000 rupees for the whole trip. The experiment was run for trips from 1 to 6 days.

The Time of Computation (TOC) for each case was measured. As anticipated, the TOC grows large as the days increase, mostly owing to the exponential increase in the solution space with the more days. It thereby aptly captures the scalability issue presented by multi-day travel itinerary planning and highlights the necessity for efficient optimization methods in processing longer trip durations.\\

\noindent The computational efficiency of the suggested itinerary optimization model was tested against both cost budget and time budget changes. In figure~\ref{fig:costbudgetvstoc}, as the cost budget rises from low values, the computation time records a minimal increment and hits a plateau, perhaps as the solution space complexity is raised. But above some cost budget limit (approximately 6000), the computation time levels off and is always low for a broad range of cost budgets. This indicates that after the feasible space is large enough, further increases in the budget no longer have a major effect on solver performance. On the contrary, figure~\ref{fig:timebudgetvstoc} illustrates that computation time is much less robust to the time budget. Though initial time budget increases cause only incremental increases in computation time, after about 900 minutes, the solver time becomes steeply exponentially increasing, reflecting the growing challenge of searching a very much larger feasible space. Particularly towards the upper end, computation time skyrockets, pointing out that cost budget is less important than time budget in defining the computational complexity of the problem.
