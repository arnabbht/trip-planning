\section{The \trip Solution}
\label{sec:ilp}

In this section, we first outline the basic solution, before expanding it for
the different extensions.
Our solution is based on \emph{mixed integer linear programming} and is, hence,
\emph{optimal}.
In other words, no other algorithm can get a strictly better solution in terms
of utility with the given constraints.

\subsection{Basic Solution}
\label{sec:basic}

We propose a \emph{mixed integer linear programming (MILP)} solution for
the \trip problem.  Each POI $v_{j}$ is associated with a binary
variable $y_{j}$, which is $1$ if it is included in the optimal
itinerary, and $0$ otherwise.  Each edge (i.e., a connection between
POIs and the source and destination) between two POIs $v_{j}$ and
$v_{k}$ is also associated with an edge binary variable $z_{j,k}$; it is
$1$ if the edge is chosen, and $0$ otherwise.  To denote $m$ different
transport modes, $z$ is superscripted with the mode.  Thus, walking,
taxi, etc. are denoted as $z^1$, $z^2$, etc.  Assuming the city has $N$
POIs, without loss of generality, we treat the source $S$ and
destination $D$ as POI $v_{0}$ and $v_{{N+1}}$ respectively for uniform
treatment.  \ignore{ The cost and time of visit of a POI $v_i$ is denoted by
$c_i$ and $t_i$ respectively, while the cost and time of traveling from
POI $j$ to POI $k$ is denoted by $c_{j,k}$ and $t_{j,k}$ respectively.}

The cost and time of visit of a POI $v_i$ is denoted by
$c_i$ and $t_i$ respectively, while the cost and time of traveling from
POI $j$ to POI $k$ via mode $m$ is denoted by $c^{m}_{j,k}$ and $t^{m}_{j,k}$ respectively.

In addition, 
we introduce an \emph{arrival time} variable for each POI, denoted by $a_i$ for node $v_i$.

Fig.~\ref{fig:basic} outlines the equations for the
MILP solution for the basic \trip problem.  Eq.~\eqref{eq:max}
represents the \emph{utility maximization} problem, where the
utility of a POI $i$ is denoted by $U_i$.  Eq.~\eqref{eq:y} marks
the choice of POIs chosen for the optimal itinerary; however,
Eq.~\eqref{eq:sd} mandates the choice of the source and destination.
Eq.~\eqref{eq:z} marks the choice of edges for the optimal
itinerary.  Eq.~\eqref{eq:cost} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:time} put the
cost and time \emph{budget constraints} by adding up the
respective values for the POIs that are chosen (corresponding to
$y = 1$).  Eq.~\eqref{eq:sout} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:din} ensure that
the source and the destination is connected to one and only one
POI in the \emph{correct direction}, i.e., via one outgoing edge
and one incoming edge respectively only.  Eq.~\eqref{eq:sin} and
Eq.~\eqref{eq:dout} ensure that there is no incoming edge to the
source and no outgoing edge from the destination.
Eq.~\eqref{eq:out} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:in} constrain that each POI
has at most one incoming and at most one outgoing edge.
Eq.~\eqref{eq:mode} ensures that the chosen mode of travel is at
most one of the $m$ possibilities.  Eq.~\eqref{eq:connectivity}
imposes the \emph{connectivity constraint} by ensuring that a
node, if chosen, has exactly one incoming edge and an outgoing
edge.  Eq.~\eqref{eq:nodechosen1} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:nodechosen2}
imposes the condition that if a node is chosen, corresponding
edges in and out of it must be present as well.
Eq.~\eqref{eq:edgechosen1} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:edgechosen2} ensures
the opposite, i.e., if an edge is chosen, the corresponding nodes
are chosen as well.  Finally, Eq.~\eqref{eq:self} ensures that
there is \emph{no self-loop}.
Eq.~\eqref{eq:subtour} models an important constraint, that of \emph{subtour
elimination}.
Since the optimization is a \emph{maximization} problem, without this subtour
elimination constraint, the solution may include isolated cycles of POIs.
Eq.~\eqref{eq:subtour} prevents it by ensuring that if POI $k$ is visited
immediately after POI $j$, the start time of $v_k$ should be more than that of
$v_j$ plus the time of visit of $v_j$ and the travel time from $v_j$ to $v_k$.

There are five sets of variables: $y, m, c, t, z$.  
The total number of variables of type $y$ in a single-day itinerary is $O(N)$ where N is number of POIs in the city.\ignore{, and in a multi-day itinerary is $O(N \cdot d)$.}
The total number of variables of type $m$ in a single-day itinerary is $O(MN^2)$ where M is total number of modes of transportation available.\ignore{, and in a multi-day itinerary is $O(mN^2 \cdot d)$.}
The total number of variables of types $c$ and $t$ in a single-day itinerary are $O(N) + O(N^2)$.\ignore{, which scale to $O(N^2 \cdot d)$ in the multi-day case.}
The total number of variables of type $z$ in a single-day itinerary is $O(N^2)$.\ignore{, and in a multi-day itinerary is $O(N^2 \cdot d)$.}

\noindent
Hence, the total number of variables in the ILP model is $O(N^2)$ and a careful analysis of all the constraints shows that the total number of constraints is $O(N^2 + |MN| + |N|)$.

\ignore{Hence, the total number of variables in the multi-day ILP model is $O(N^2 \cdot d)$ which boils down to $O(N^2)$ in case of single day itinerary.}
